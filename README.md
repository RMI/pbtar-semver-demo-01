## Running the application

1. Clone the Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RMI/pbtar
cd pbtar
```

2. Create an `.env` file to store the desired frontend port

```sh
cp env.example .env
```

3. Run the services with `docker compose`

```sh
# build the image
docker compose build

# run the container
docker compose up --detach

# do both
docker compose up --detach --build
```

The React web service will be accessible at http://localhost.

4. Shutdown the docker container

```sh
docker compose down
```

## Deployments

The application is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps:

- **Production**: [View Production Site](https://green-pebble-01f5d5c1e.6.azurestaticapps.net/)  
  _Deployed automatically when changes are merged to the `production` branch_

- **Development**: [View Development Site](https://green-pebble-01f5d5c1e-main.westus2.6.azurestaticapps.net/)  
  _Reflects the current state of the `main` branch_

Pull requests automatically deploy to preview environments with URLs provided in the PR comments.

## Development

### Set-Up

This project uses Node.js and npm for dependency management.

To install Node.js, follow the [official installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd pbtar
npm install
```

2. Running the Frontend
   You can locally serve the frontend _alone_ with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The local development service will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. It automatically reloads on file changes.

3. Running with `docker compose`
   If you prefer to run the entire application stack using Docker, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including the frontend, backend, and database. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

4. Building the application
   To render the site,

```bash
npm run build

# or for a PROD BUILD
VITE_BUILD_MODE=production npm run build
```

Then you can serve the `dist/` directory using your favorite local server.
For example, to use python's server,

```bash
python3 -m http.server 9001 -d ./dist
```

## Contributing

Dependencies are managed using `npm`. To add a new library, run:

```bash
npm install <library> # for runtime dependencies
npm install --save-dev <library> # for development dependencies
```

## Testing

This project uses Vitest for unit testing. To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code consistency:

```bash
# Check code for issues
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

## Releases

This project uses [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release) to manage release versions.
See "Releases" on the right of the main GitHub repository page to see the latest released version, or click through to see pre-releases.

### Managing Releases (For developers)

To trigger an update in released version, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in your normal development process.
Commits with a `feat` prefix (in the commit summary) will cause a bump in the minor version (`x.X.x`), while a `fix`, `build`, `docs`, `perf`, `refactor`, `style`, or `test` prefix will bump the patch version (`x.x.X`).
The commit summary used will appear in the release notes.

The "released" version of the application is updated when the `production` branch is updated, but we can see pre-release versions by updating `main` (updates `x.x.x-dev.y`) or `next` (updates `x.x.x-rc.y`).
When opening a Pull Request, an GitHub workflow will dry-run the release process and comment with a preview of the expected version tag and release notes.
