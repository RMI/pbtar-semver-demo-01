    "overview": "The ZETI Net Zero Pathway roadmap shows how the global energy sector can achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It is designed to examine what would need to happen to the energy system over the next 30 years to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The pathway calls for rapid deployment of available technologies between now and 2030, with clean technologies in heavy industry and long-distance transport developed and brought to market in the 2030s. The pathway also requires innovation, international cooperation, and significant investment.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario represents the most comprehensive global pathway to net zero and is highly recommended as a reference scenario for any climate transition assessment. It has excellent sectoral coverage and provides detailed milestones for different technologies and regions. However, analysts should note that it may be less detailed for specific regional considerations in Southeast Asia or other developing regions. Consider complementing this scenario with regional scenarios for a more complete assessment.",

This scenario leads to high physical risks as temperature rise is projected to reach 3°C or higher by 2100. The scenario assumes no additional policies are implemented beyond what is already in place, resulting in higher emissions throughout the projection period compared to other FGCN scenarios.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is useful as a baseline comparison to understand the implications of inaction. When conducting climate transition assessments, this scenario helps illustrate the risks of maintaining the status quo. We recommend using this alongside more ambitious scenarios to show the contrast between different policy approaches. This scenario is particularly valuable for stress testing and understanding physical climate risks.",

The scenario includes detailed projections for solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal deployment across the region, with country-specific considerations for Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. It provides a technically feasible and economically optimal pathway that aligns with the 1.5°C global temperature goal.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is highly recommended for any assessment of power generation companies in Southeast Asia. It provides more regionally specific insights than global models and accounts for the unique characteristics of Southeast Asian power markets. The scenario is particularly useful for evaluating transition plans of coal-heavy power generators in the region. We recommend using this alongside global scenarios for a more comprehensive assessment.",

    "publishedDate": "2022-11-30",
    "overview": "This scenario explores a transition pathway that heavily leverages carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to reduce emissions from existing coal power plants and industrial facilities. Rather than rapid decommissioning of coal assets, this scenario models a more gradual transition where CCS is deployed at scale to allow continued operation of some coal plants while still meeting climate goals. The scenario includes detailed modeling of CCS deployment curves, costs, and infrastructure requirements.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario provides a useful alternative perspective to scenarios that focus primarily on renewable deployment. It is particularly relevant for assessments of companies with younger coal assets that may be difficult to retire early, especially in regions like Southeast Asia where coal remains a significant part of the energy mix. However, we recommend using this scenario alongside others, as it relies heavily on technology deployment that has yet to be proven at scale and may overestimate the potential for CCS.",

The scenario achieves net zero emissions in the EU by 2040, a decade earlier than the current official target.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is valuable for assessing European companies and understanding the potential impacts of more ambitious EU climate policies. It presents a useful \"high ambition\" case for European policy evolution and is particularly relevant for financial institutions with significant European exposure.

    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is recommended as a scientific reference point for Paris-aligned transition pathways. It has comprehensive global coverage across all major sectors and is backed by the scientific authority of the GEC.

    "overview": "The Planned Transition scenario assumes climate policies are introduced early and gradually become more stringent. Carbon prices increase gradually, giving companies and consumers time to adapt. Physical risks are relatively low because climate change is effectively mitigated, while transition risks are manageable due to the predictable policy environment. Global warming is limited to 2°C by the end of the century.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is valuable for understanding the financial implications of a well-managed transition. It represents a \"middle ground\" approach that balances climate ambition with economic realities. We recommend using this scenario for financial institutions looking to understand potential transition pathways that minimize market disruption while still achieving significant emissions reductions. The gradual nature of this scenario makes it useful for identifying near-term transition opportunities and risks.",

Sudden and unanticipated policies are introduced later to rapidly reduce emissions and meet climate goals. This leads to higher transition risks due to the unexpected nature of policy changes and limited time for adaptation. The scenario still limits warming to 2°C, but with higher economic costs than an orderly transition.",
    "expertRecommendation": "This scenario is particularly useful for stress testing and understanding potential financial stability implications of delayed climate action. It helps financial institutions identify potential vulnerabilities in their portfolios to sudden policy changes or technology shifts. We recommend using this scenario alongside more orderly scenarios to understand the range of potential transition pathways and associated risks. This scenario is especially relevant for financial institutions with exposure to carbon-intensive sectors that may face abrupt policy changes.",
